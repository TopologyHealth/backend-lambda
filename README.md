# EMR Backend Token Creation - Lambda Function

## Overview

This repository contains an AWS Lambda function that handles EMR FHIR backend token management, interacts with an API gateway, and manages secrets. It is designed to be deployed on AWS and integrated with services like API Gateway and AWS Secrets Manager.

### File Structure

- **TokenHandler.ts**: Handles operations related to token validation and manipulation.
- **TokenResponse.ts**: Manages responses related to token requests.
- **gateway.ts**: Manages API Gateway interactions.
- **index.ts**: The main entry point for the Lambda function. This is where the logic to handle incoming requests begins.
- **secret.ts**: Manages interaction with secrets, likely from AWS Secrets Manager.
- **KMS.ts**: Manages interaction with AWS Key Management Service.
- **utils.ts**: Utilities for manipulating objects
- **package.json**: Contains project dependencies and scripts.
- **tsconfig.json** & **aws-toolkit-tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration files for the project.
- **launch.json**: A file used to pass the event object into the Lambda function during local testing, allowing for easy debugging in an IDE like VSCode.

### Using `launch.json`

The `launch.json` file is used to simulate AWS Lambda events locally during development using AWS SAM. Hereâ€™s the key configuration:

- **Handler**: `index.handler`
- **Runtime**: `nodejs18.x`
- **Payload**: A sample payload with headers (e.g., `clientId`, `emrType`) and `requestContext` containing user identity information.
- **Environment Variables**: Includes an environment variable `API_ID`.

#### Example Payload from `launch.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "clientId": "71acdb69-78ea-4cfb-b1ba-edf86fe856ce",
    "emrType": "epic"
  },
  "requestContext": {
    "identity": {
      "userArn": "arn:aws:sts::105227342372:assumed-role/josh-epic-sandbox-71acdb69-token-getter/APIGatewaySession"
    }
  },
    "environmentVariables": {
      "API_ID": "********",
      "REGION": "us-east-2"
    }
}
```

This event simulates an API Gateway event. You can use this configuration for testing and debugging the Lambda function locally.

### Required AWS Resources

To ensure this Lambda function works correctly, the following AWS resources must be provisioned:

- **AWS Lambda**: The core service to run this function.
- **API Gateway**: The function interacts with an API Gateway to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **IAM Role for Lambda**: The Lambda function must be associated with an IAM role that grants it the following permissions:
  - **Invoke API Gateway**: To allow the Lambda function to make requests to API Gateway.
  - **Access Secrets Manager**: If your Lambda function accesses secrets, ensure the IAM role has permissions to retrieve those secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
  - **CloudWatch Logs**: Ensure that the function has logging permissions so that it can log execution details to CloudWatch for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Example IAM Policy

Here is an example of the permissions required for the Lambda function:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:<function-name>"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "apigateway:Invoke",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:apigateway:<region>::/restapis/<api-id>/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:<secret-name>"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:ListRoleTags",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "kms:ListResourceTags",
              "kms:Sign"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Build the Lambda Function**: Use TypeScript to compile the files into JavaScript by running:

    ```bash
    tsc
    ```

3. **Package the Lambda function**: Zip all the necessary files, including the compiled JavaScript files and `node_modules`.

    ```bash
    zip -r lambda_function.zip .
    ```

4. **Deploy to AWS Lambda**: Use the AWS CLI to create or update the Lambda function.

    ```bash
    aws lambda update-function-code --function-name <your-lambda-function-name> --zip-file fileb://lambda_function.zip
    ```

### Local Testing

- You can test this Lambda function locally using the `launch.json` file provided. This file is configured to simulate events and environment variables specific to this project.

### Notes

- Ensure that your IAM role attached to this Lambda function has the correct permissions to access the API Gateway and AWS Secrets Manager.
- This Lambda function is written in TypeScript. Make sure that all TypeScript files are properly compiled before deploying.
